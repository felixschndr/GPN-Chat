# GPN-Chat

This repository aims to create a LLM with the help of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to be able to answer questions based on the public talks of the
[Gulaschprogrammiernacht (GPN)](https://entropia.de/GPN22/en).

The Gulaschprogrammiernacht is an annual four-day event organized by Entropia e.V., part of the Chaos Computer
Club (CCC) in Karlsruhe, Germany. Originally conceived by computer science students in Karlsruhe in 2002, it has grown
into one of Europe's major gatherings for the hacker community. The event, which is held at the ZKM | Center for Art and
Media as well as the State Academy of Design Karlsruhe, includes hacking, programming, **lectures**, workshops, and as the
name suggests, a significant amount of goulash cooking to feed participants. 

There are many interesting **lectures**, however they are all quite long (about an hour each) and I currently don't have the time to listen to them. Thus, my idea was to create a LLM which I could ask questions about all the talks.
